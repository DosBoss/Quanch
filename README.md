# Quanch
Multi-purpose launcher for Quake

This tool aims to be a one stop shop for all things ID,

Singleplayer and Multiplayer tabs will allow you to choose mods, 
tweak settings and browse/join online servers with ease!

I eventually plan to port Quake Injector into this launcher as well, 
and with any luck, modify it to work with Doom engine games :)

Roadmap:
- Singleplayer launcher released
- Add support for other Quake games
- Multiplayer functionality, Server browser/creator for all Quake games
- Quake Injector ported into launcher
- Doom engine games support (Possible project rename)
- Modifiy ported Quake Injector code to work with Doom engine games via wad-archive
- Inbuilt IRC server
